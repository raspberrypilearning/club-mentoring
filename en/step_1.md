## Introduction

Code Club is a global community of free coding clubs where young people develop skills and confidence to create with digital technologies. We call the adults who help run a Code Club mentors.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Mentors**</span> are the backbone of Code Club. Without them, Code Clubs would not exist!
</p>

This course will focus on training mentors who support young learners through providing encouragement, guidance or technical help. 

Tasks are marked by a green background and a grey checkbox in the top-right corner. Use a pen and paper, or device to take notes to assist your learning.

Once completed, you should:
+ Understand the different activities mentors in a Code Club do
+ Recognise different mentoring styles used at a Code Club
+ Have learnt a little about the most popular coding languages used in clubs
+ Know what resources are available to support mentors
and much more!

## What happens at a Code Club

In a Code Club session, young people usually create a project like a game, app, or website using code. Often the session starts with a short introduction or ice-breaker, then young people start creating with code. Creators can work alone or in groups. Clubs are collaborative spaces, where chat between the creators is encouraged. Near the end of the session some creators share what they have made with the group.
