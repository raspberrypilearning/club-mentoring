## Introduction

Code Club is a global community of free coding clubs where young people develop skills and confidence to create with digital technologies. 
We call the adults who help run a Code Club mentors. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Mentors**</span> are the backbone of Code Club. Without them, Code Clubs would not exist!
</p>

This course will primarily focus on training mentors who support young learners through providing encouragement, guidance or technical help.

Once completed, you should:
+ Understand the different tasks mentors in a Code Club do
+ Recognise different mentoring styles used at a Code Club
+ Have learnt a little about the most popular coding languages used in clubs
+ Know what resources are available to support mentors
and much more!

## What happens at a Code Club

In a Code Club session, young people usually create a project like a game, app, or website using code. Often the session starts with a short introduction or ice-breaker, then young people start creating with code. Creators can work alone or in groups. Near the end of the session some creators share what they have made with the group.

Code Clubs run in a variety of different spaces and contexts. Clubs are collaborative spaces, where chat between the creators is encouraged. 

The number of mentors needed depends on the venue size and how many creators attend the sessions. We recommend a ratio of at least one adult to every ten young people, unless you are a teacher or have teachers helping at your club.

## Who is involved in a Code Club
Within a club there are usually the young people attending (creators), those volunteering their time to support the club, and in community-based settings parents and guardians of younger creators.

title: Club leaders
---
Club leaders are the adults who volunteer to take charge of setting up, running, and maintaining a club. Once the club is open, they can be viewed as project managers of a Code Club. They don’t have to be technical, but they do have to have good organisational skills. 

We recommend club leaders also have a co-leader or deputy leader in place so that the club can run even if the club leader cannot attend a session.

title: Mentors
---
Mentors facilitate learning by:
- encouraging young people
- helping them get set up
- talking them through a project
- supporting them to find their own solutions.

Mentors are not expected to have all the answers. 

Some mentors have programming skills and/or coding experience (e.g. HTML, Python, Scratch, Unity). This can influence the topics covered in the club. 

They can also help:
- organise the space
- prepare learning resources or hardware
- manage ticketing
- promote the club

You don’t need to have coding or teaching experience to be a mentor.

title: Youth mentors
---
Experienced creators can become youth mentors to help support other young people. Youth mentoring helps to develop interpersonal skills such as communication, presentation, and confidence. Youth mentoring should be encouraged. They can be fantastic role models to other creators.
