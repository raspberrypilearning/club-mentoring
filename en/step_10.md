## Develop your skills
Talk to the club leader about your reasons for volunteering at the club. Remember people's motivations can change and develop over time. Be sure to communicate regularly with the club leader so they can best support your needs and growth. 
When you identify a skill you want to develop, you can ask the club leader for more responsibility in that area. For example, you could:
• Lead a session on a topic you know
• Create the next Code Club event on the ticketing system
• Set up the club space and welcome parents, guardians, and creators

Mentors can also participate in Code Club training, either individually or as part of a group.
