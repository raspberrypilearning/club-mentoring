### Mentor input and involvement in sessions
It's important that you have a great experience volunteering with Code Club. It is helpful if you share with the club leader or other mentors what your interests and motivations are, this will help ensure:
+ Your role is fulfilling
+ You are performing tasks that are interesting to you
+ Ideas for adaptations that could be beneficial to mentors and the wider club are discussed and acted on
