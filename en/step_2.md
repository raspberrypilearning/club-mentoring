Code Clubs offer so much more for young people than learning to create with code.  With the support of mentors, creators develop a wide range of skills. Young people learn:

+ Confidence with technology
+ Communication and teamwork
+ Real-world applications
+ Critical thinking
+ Creativity
+ Empathy
+ Resilience
+ Presentation skills
+ Coding concepts and programming skills
