title: Club leaders
---
Club leaders are the adults who volunteer to take charge of setting up, running, and maintaining a club. Once the club is open, they can be viewed as project managers of a Code Club. They don’t have to be technical, but they do have to have good organisational skills. 

We recommend club leaders also have a co-leader or deputy leader in place so that the club can run even if the club leader cannot attend a session.

title: Mentors
---
The number of mentors needed depends on the venue size and how many creators attend the sessions. We recommend a ratio of at least one adult to every ten young people, unless you are a teacher or have teachers helping at your club.

Mentors facilitate learning by:
- encouraging young people
- helping them get set up
- talking them through a project
- supporting them to find their own solutions.

Mentors are not expected to have all the answers. 

Some mentors have programming skills and/or coding experience (e.g. HTML, Python, Scratch, Unity). This can influence the topics covered in the club. 

They can also help:
- organise the space
- prepare learning resources or hardware
- manage ticketing
- promote the club

You don’t need to have coding or teaching experience to be a mentor.

---
Experienced creators can become youth mentors to help support other young people. Youth mentoring helps to develop interpersonal skills such as communication, presentation, and confidence. Youth mentoring should be encouraged. They can be fantastic role models to other creators.

## Time commitment
We recommend a **3-month minimum commitment** to mentoring at a Code Club to give you a chance to meaningfully engage with the experience. Although we hope that you enjoy it so much that you continue for much longer.
