Code Clubs offer so much more for young people than learning to create with code.  With the support of mentors, **creators develop a wide range of skills**. Young people learn:

+ Confidence with technology
+ Communication and teamwork
+ Real-world applications
+ Critical thinking
+ Creativity
+ Empathy
+ Resilience
+ Presentation skills
+ Coding concepts and programming skills

## Group management and expectation setting
Itâ€™s important that sessions are fun for all those involved. To help make sessions enjoyable for everyone, we encourage club leaders and mentors to work with creators to agree some rules at the start of the year or term. These can then be added to our [rules poster template](https://assets.ctfassets.net/zsyyd4yzh6xx/72KiBgyhW9QDVONFjD04KB/8e9ae5a4bc0a925d2fa1d8359f079289/Code_Club_Rules_Poster_2024_V4.pdf){:target="_blank"}  and put up in a place where all can see them during sessions.

**Ask** the club leader if the club you will be mentoring at already has rules in place.

It is important for volunteers to take responsibility for promoting good and courteous behaviour themselves during the sessions too.

**Read** our [mentor code of behaviour](https://assets.ctfassets.net/zsyyd4yzh6xx/5DU80tjidPoa6L0Tlq6uiY/4c02613c80e81aa276c5d8ab6f2a3ad0/Code_Club_Mentor_Code_of_Behaviour_A4_V5_Digital.pdf) guidance.

In community-based clubs a parent or guardian of creators under 12 should be present at sessions. If a creator is disruptive check in with them first to resolve the issue. You can also talk with their parent or guardian. They might be frustrated with a project, reacting to an external stressor, or have additional needs that are not being supported.
