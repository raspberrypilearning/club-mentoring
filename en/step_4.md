At a Code Club, you will see a mix of different mentoring skills in use depending on the situation. Being able to use different mentoring skills is important.

title: Encouragement
---
A positive attitude and encouragement helps young people take pride in learning something they initially find difficult.
  
For example:
+ “Well done for getting this far through the project by yourself. Let’s look through the last few lines of code to see where the issue might be.”
+ “Well done for completing this project. It would be great if you can share it with the group at the end of the session so they can see and learn from the work you did.”

title: Questioning
---

Ask thoughtful, leading questions to stimulate thinking. These questions can lead creators to consider new techniques for solving a problem, encourage recall, and help check they understand the material.

  
For example:
+ The project: “Why did you choose this project? What was the original idea?”
+ The code: “What does this section of code do? Why have you taken this approach?”
+ The process: “Which part of the project was most successful? What changed when you developed the project?”
+ The outcomes: “Did you make what you planned? Did feedback or testing cause you to change your project? What would you do differently if you were starting the project again?”

title: Supporting self-help
---
We use the motto ‘**Ask three, then me**’ to encourage young people to try self-help strategies before asking a mentor.

Encourage creators to:
1. Ask themselves (test the code and try to find the error)
2. Ask their peers
3. Ask a search engine
4. If they still need help, ask a mentor
  
For example:
+ "Look at what the most recent piece of code you added was. Was the code running without any errors before you added that in?"
+ "If you search on Google for 'code to add a link in HTML', you should find what you are looking for."
+ "Did you ask [name of another creator] how they got their code to work? They're working on a similar project."

title: Direct guidance
---
Use direct guidance when a creator is stuck and needs more specific feedback. This is particularly useful for younger creators who cannot find the answer themselves or who have limited experience of typing.
  
For example:
+ “Here on line 30, I see an error in the code that seems to be causing the issue.
What do you think it could be?”
+ “You can change the sprite’s costume using the purple ‘Looks’ blocks in Scratch.
Check through the ‘Looks’ blocks yourself and pick the one you think would work
best for your project.”

title: Direct instruction
---
Direct instruction can be useful when introducing a concept, a topic, or some logic to the whole club or a larger group of creators. However, we suggest not using this approach too often, as otherwise, your club will feel like a formal learning environment.

<span style="color: #0faeb0"> Mentoring isn’t about knowing everything.</p>

If a creator asks you a question that you don't know the answer to, that's ok! Tell them that you don't know and support them to find the answer. It is helpful for young people to know that it’s fine not to have all the answers and that mentors are learning too.
