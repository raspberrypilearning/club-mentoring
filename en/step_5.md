## Helping creators of different ages and abilities

title: Younger learners
---
As a general rule, younger children tend to have a shorter attention span.

If your club has younger creators, try breaking up the coding session into shorter activity slots, changing the activity, moving people around, or including a break.
Including [ice-breakers and unplugged activities](https://codeclub.org/en/resources/activities) alongside coding activities can be great for this age group.

title: Group creators together
---
If creators sit together based on experience or age, they will be more able to support each other.

If creators work in pairs on a project, for example where you are sharing a device between two creators, you can use [pair programming](rpf.io/pair-programming).

title: Focus on creator interests
---
You will create a more meaningful learning experience if you allow creators to work on something they are interested in. If they need some help deciding what to do, provide a few options for them to pick to boost their motivation and encourage greater independance. 

Creators can also adapt our projects to make them more relavant to their interests - for example changing the sprites or background in Scratch, or making a website about a topic important to them.

title: Consider their level of experience
---
Choosing projects suited to a creators experience level can ensure they stay engaged and develop skills progressively. Overly difficult tasks may lead to frustration, while overly simple ones can cause boredom.

If they need support choosing the next thing to make consider their current abilities and past experiences. Offer a few options and encourage young people to share what they think of the project while they are completing it. 

If they:
- are sitting looking at the screen, seem stuck or frustrated, check in with them to offer support or guidance.
- complete the project very quickly, or seem bored by it, suggest ways they could add to it or projects that will progress them further.

title: Reflecting on learnings
--- 
Encouraging learners to revisit the important learnings from the project. This solidifies new knowledge and provides opportunities for mastery. We provide opportunities for this in our [new project paths](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths).

--- task ---

Encourage reflection by asking questions of young people, such as:
+ What does this piece of code do?
+ How did you do that?
+ What would happen if you tried … instead? 
+ What would you do differently if you were starting the project again?

title: Celebrate creator success
---
It is important to celebrate creators’ achievements and contributions to the Code Club. Celebrating achievements with certificates, progress charts and even showcasing projects at the end of a session or as part of an event like Coolest Projects can help show creators that you recognise the effort they have made and can motivate them to continue on their digital making journey. 

We will go into more detail on this in the "Celebrate and showcase" section later on.

## Culturally responsive mentoring

<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
  
Coding can help young people to participate in and shape a rapidly changing world. It's important that learning materials present computing as a career that is open to all and avoid historic stereotypes related to computing. This includes how topics are presented, as well as the language and media assets chosen to introduce them. 
  
Our learning materials are designed to be inclusive. Care should be taken when using other materials.

The materials you use should present computing as an activity and career that is open to everyone.

It’s important that creators can make projects that incorporate their knowledge, culture, and heritage.
  
Culturally responsive mentoring helps creators think critically about the world and ask questions about fairness, power, and social issues. It gives them chances to work on problems that matter to them and their communities.

--- collapse ---
  
---
title: Examples of culturally responsive mentoring practices
---  

+ Using young people's own culture and experiences to help them learn.
+ Letting creators pick projects that matter to them and show their cultural identity.
+ Talking about fairness, social issues, and bias.
Using fair teaching methods, like open-ended questions and group discussions.
+ Showing different cultures in learning materials and making sure everyone can use them.
+ Providing inclusive representations of a range of cultures, and making sure learning materials are accessible
+ Using less structured guidance approaches, such as open-ended, exploratory activities and collaborative tasks that encourage discussion

## Accessibility practices for Code Clubs
Code Club welcomes creators and mentors of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities. At your club, there might be people with disabilities and accessibility requirements.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Everyone’s needs and abilities will be different, and this goes for all members of your Code Club — not just those with a disability.</p>
  
To make your Code Club more accessible:

+ **Listen to creators, parents, and guardians**: Make sure the clubs contact information is up-to-date and people have the opportunity to share how creators needs can be supported.
+ **Use inclusive language**: Use language that is positive and free from discrimination and stereotyping. Avoid terms that might be offensive, or any language that excludes or isolates a person from other members of the club. 
+ **Make reasonable adjustments**: Talk about any adjustments you can make to support creators and how best to work with assistive technologies or aids.

title: Examples of reasonable adjustments in a club
---

+ Rearranging tables and chairs to create an accessible space.
+ Designating a quiet corner.
+ Providing a written or visual schedule of the session at the beginning.
+ Providing larger screens for anyone with visual impairments.
+ Printing instructions in a large, easy-to-read font.
+ Asking mentors to communicate slowly and clearly when they explain something.
+ Introducing the creator to a mentor who attends regularly, so they know an adult by name and have a friendly face to look out for.
+ Allowing movement breaks. Some people can find it challenging to sit for long periods, even if they find the activity engaging.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">If there are a number of creators with disabilities, you could appoint a mentor as an accessibility officer to oversee these adjustments.</p>

And remember, not all disabilities or additional needs are visible.
