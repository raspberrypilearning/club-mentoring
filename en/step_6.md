## Learning resources

Code Clubs are hardware and software agnostic. That means that creators and mentors can use whatever resources, tools, and programming languages suit their needs. There are lots of freely available resources online. 

One way we support clubs is by providing  ice-breaker activities, unplugged resources, guided projects and an online Code Editor tool for free to use in your Code Club.  
  
## Icebreakers and unplugged activities
Icebreakers are a great way to introduce new creators to other club members, encourage communication, and create a sense of belonging. We recommend running an icebreaker activity at the start of a session when you have new creators join. Offline or unplugged activities take place away from a computer and model key concepts (e.g. selection, variables, algorithms) in different ways. These short games are fantastic ways to help creators feel relaxed, and can also help young people learn coding concepts and terminology in a fun, informal way.

## Our project resources
On the [Code Club projects site](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en){:target="_blank"}, we have a huge range of guided project paths and standalone projects for creators to try

These projects are created by experienced educators and tested extensively so that we know they work. They are designed for creators to learn independently, and support them to use different technologies to bring their ideas to life through customising their projects.

Familiarise yourself with the projects creators are working on so you are better able to support them.

### [Improved project paths](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths){:target="_blank"}

Some of our educational projects are in a path format to better support creators who want to learn coding and gradually develop independence.

---
title: New path structure
---

Each path is made up of six projects, of three different types, in a 3-2-1 structure:

+ The first **three Explore projects** introduce creators to a set of skills and knowledge, and provide step-by-step instructions to help creators develop initial confidence. 
+ The next **two Design projects** are opportunities for creators to practise the skills they learnt in the previous Explore projects, and to express themselves creatively. 
+ In the final **one Invent project**, creators focus on completing a project to meet a project brief for a particular audience. The project brief is written so that they can meet it using the skills they’ve learnt by following the path up to this point.

### New project features

We’ve also introduced some new features to add interactivity, choice, and authenticity to each project in a path:

Provide interesting and relevant facts about the skills and knowledge being taught.

title: Design decision points
---
Allow creators to make choices about how their project looks and what it does, based on their preferences and interests.

title: Debugging tips

---
Throughout each project, debugging tips give creators guidance for finding and fixing common coding mistakes.

---
title: Project reflection steps
---
Solidify new knowledge and provide opportunities for mastery by letting creators revisit the important learnings from the project. Common misconceptions are highlighted, and they are guided to the correct answer.

title: An open-ended upgrade step
---
The end of each project offers inspiration for young people, by giving them ideas for ways in which they could continue to improve upon their project in the future.
